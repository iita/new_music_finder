# Snappy title when I come up with one

When I was a kid, I used to go to the library every week or two and borrow 10 CDs based entirely on the cover art, album title, and name of the artist.
I wanted to recreate that feeling of discovery and find music from outside of my comfort zone and the self-imposed genre bubble recommendation algorithms enforce.


### Prerequisites

You will need a valid Spotify login and to [register as a Spotify developer](https://developer.spotify.com/). This will give you the credentials needed to make these API requests.
I recommend adding said credentials as environmental variables, with the names
```
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=
```
You'll find these on your Dashboard after registration.
